	Import file.

	Handling Returns: include returns FALSE on failure and raises a warning. Successful includes,
	unless overridden by the included file, return 1.

	It is possible to execute a return statement inside an included file in order to terminate processing in
	that file and return to the script which called it.

	Also, it's possible to return values from included files.
